this i Prateek Nanda and this is the project i have amde along with 2 othner team members for my college project .
The porject shows an E-COMMERCE website made using HTML CSS JAVASCRIPT MySQL PHP and some basic BOOTSTRAPPING.
BEFORE SUBMISSION I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE TEACHER THAT THIS ALSO IS A PERSONAL PROJECT THAT I AM CURRENTLY WORKING ON AND THUS INVOLVES BACKEND DEVELOPMENT AS WELL. HOWEVER AS FAR AS THE PROJECT IS CONCERNED THAT HAS TO BE JUDGED ON THE BASIS OF html css and js ONLY.
